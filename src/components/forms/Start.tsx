           <h1>BEFORE INCORPORATION</h1>
            Filing in the incorporation application is not rocket science, but it will take you a lot of time and effort to complete the entire process yourself.
            <br/>
            We highly suggest to use our incorporation services. With that peace of mind, when arranging the paperwork via our online platform, you will only need to prepare in advanced:
            <br/>
            <ul className="dashed my-3">
                <li>Intended company name </li>
                <li>Directors’ and shareholders’ passport or Hong Kong Identity copies,</li>
                <li>Detailed residential address (No PO Box),</li>
                <li>Contact email and phone number</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
    )
}

export default Start;
