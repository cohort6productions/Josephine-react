Branch: add-routes
Dev: Ivan

This version is part of the work to make clicking to other pages work in conjunction with the current incorporation pages. To achieve this, I've added "React-router-dom", which allows the frontend to expand with the capacity of accepting more pages.

## Added

-   React-router-dom
-   Changelog to reflect iterations of changes
-   error page for testing

## Changed

-   branch name from "non_incorporation_pages" to "add-routes"
-   Moved incorporation into a page nested under "DefaultRoutes"

## Removed
